            <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
            <p class="description">
                At AstralFlights, our journey began with a
            dream—to open the vast expanse of the
            universe to everyone. Founded by a group
            of passionate space enthusiasts, we
            envisioned a future where interstellar
            travel is as accessible and enjoyable as
            earthly adventures.<br>

            Our founders, driven by their love for
            exploration and innovation, spent years
            researching and developing the
            technology to make space travel safe,
            comfortable, and thrilling. What started as
            a small project has now grown into a
            leading company in the interstellar travel
            industry, offering unique and
            unforgettable experiences to explorers
            worldwide.
